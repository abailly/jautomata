/**
 * An interface for abstract state machines.
 * <p>
 * A state machine - or labelled transition system - is defined by
 * a tuple <code>(Q,S,q0,d)</code> where:
 * <ul>
 * <li><code>Q</code> is a set of states ;</li>
 * <li><code>S</code> is a finite set of labels ;</li>
 * <li><code>q0</code> is the initial state of the machine ;</li>
 * <li><code>d</code> is a transition relation in <code>Q x S x Q</code>.
 * </ul>
 * This definition is slightly modified for this interface as the initials 
 * is defined as a {@see java.util.Set} instead of a single state. <code>null</code>
 * may be used to denote <em>silent transitions</em>, that is unobservable 
 * internal behaviour of the machine, which can lead to non determinism.
 * <p>
 * The {@see rationals.Automaton} is the main implementation for this interface.
